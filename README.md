# About bekwest
bekwest is a Minipay-based on-chain funding platform for donors to fund African educational initiatives 

# Current Features
## Automatic payouts
Once voters have completed voting on an application for a donation that a donor created, payouts are instant. Voters get a reward (15% share), the grantee gets (75%) and the platform keeps 10%.
## On-chain voting
The delegation of the grant is purely controlled by the voting mechanism. Everything happens on-chain, and grants are rewarded based on number of votes. A donor can trust that the system will work without needing oversight.
